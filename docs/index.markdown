I am a fourth-year PhD student at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jonathan Weare](https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/).

My research interest is in analysis, design and application of Monte Carlo sampling methods.

Before my PhD study, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computational Mathematics at Peking University. 
I worked with Prof. [Lei Zhang](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhanglei/) and Prof. [Tiejun Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/litj/). During my undergraduate study, I was mostly interested in mathematical modeling of biological system, which in the end inspires me to study more on stochasticity.
